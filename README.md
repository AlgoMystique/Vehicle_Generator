This tool is designed to allow developers to expand an existing codebase by adding new vehicle types and actions, providing a practical example of object-oriented programming and class-based design.

Unique Prompts for Trucks and Motorbikes: Users are prompted for additional information unique to each vehicle type.

Truck-Specific Action: Users can perform an action exclusive to the Truck class.
